# Air quality during COVID in Pittsburgh  

The COVID lockdowns provided a natural experiment to examine air quality changes.  Scientists around the globe seized this opportunity; some of the most striking comparisons were found in megacities, e.g., Delhi ([in *The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/11/positively-alpine-disbelief-air-pollution-falls-lockdown-coronavirus)).  But how did the COVID lockdowns change air quality in an industrial city like Pittsburgh?  This research used ground-based air quality monitors operated by the [Allegheny County Department of Health](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Programs/Air-Quality/Air-Quality.aspx).  This provided data on particulate matter and other critera pollutants.
