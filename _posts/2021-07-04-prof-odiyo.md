The University of Venda [announced](https://www.univen.ac.za/news/announcement-on-the-passing-of-the-former-dean-of-the-school-of-environmental-sciences-prof-john-ogony-odiyo/) the loss of Prof. Odiyo.  Prof. Odiyo was a brilliant researcher and academic leader, he was larger than life and always gave the warmest reception for us when we were fortunate enough to visit the university.  He will be missed.
