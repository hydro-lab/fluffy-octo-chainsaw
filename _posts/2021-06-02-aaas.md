**Applications are now open** for the AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowships!  This program places recent graduates (typically doctorate) in all branches of the federal government.  

The AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowships (STPF) program is seeking applicants for its next class of fellows. Gain hands-on policy experience, help develop and execute solutions to address societal challenges, and join a highly accomplished corps of over 3,000 alumni fellows who are leaders in government, academia, industry and the nonprofit sector.  The STPF program seeks candidates with strong STEM credentials, an interest in career enhancement, and a desire to learn about federal policymaking.  These transformative fellowships take you to Washington DC for one year to serve in an office in any of the three branches of federal government. The application deadline is 01 November 2021. Apply today at [www.stpf-aaas.org](http://www.stpf-aaas.org).  

Let me know if you have any questions about the program.  I was a fellow from 2012 to 2014 at USAID.  The experience is transformative.
