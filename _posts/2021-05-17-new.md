Here is the new lab website.  It is very much a work in progress.  It is hosted on GitHub.  Students in the lab group can post blog entries to it; just add a markdown file in the _posts folder.  For more details, please see the [instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/08-blogging/) and our lab wiki for header information and formatting.
