Below I have included two links. One directs you to a short YouTube video of me briefly explaining my research project (~3 minutes), and the other takes you to a poster I created for the graduate research symposium. If you're bored, have free time, or just want to learn a bit more about the relationship between COVID-19 and air pollution, feel free to check them out! The poster and accompanying video will also be available on the graduate research symposium page once it goes live on March 8th.
