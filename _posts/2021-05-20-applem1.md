Apple has recently come out with a new chip that is now available in both laptop and desktop computers.  These chips were designed to be more efficient.  Unfortunately, it came at a high cost.  Specifically, some software is not compatable with the new chips.  As a work-around, Apple provides an interpreter, *Rosetta 2*, which initial reports indicate is slow, which makes sense as it is another layer of software before the computer can actually do the work.  Mainly, I'm concerned about Matlab and R/RStudio.  The [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/641925-is-matlab-supported-on-apple-silicon-macs) has put out a statement about Matlab on the new chip; it will run through *Rosetta 2*, but it looks like you need an updated version.  R is a bit more complicated; for now, it looks like R will run, but through *Rosetta 2*, according to the [r-project](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/11/02/will-r-work-on-apple-silicon/index.html), but RStudio for Apple M1 does not appear to be available yet.  

This M1 better be worth it to someone.
